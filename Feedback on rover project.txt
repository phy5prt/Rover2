The unit tests aren’t really unit tests. A unit test should test each part of the system in isolation.

Further to the above, in no circumstance should unit tests should not integrate into main application. (so i need to find a way of mocking console which i could do hence having to put it into the code)

There’s no separation of classes into separate files. (This is from making things in unity not vs - do mvc course)

Using nested classes instead of utilisation of namespaces. (go through sololearn and plan out version 2)

Using string.format and string interpolation in the same code block are un-required. String interpolation converts to string format at compile time. 
There are circumstances where we are using one or the other, in this case we could do with using the same for consistency.

Code style needs to be consistent (casing for public / private / parameters should be the same throughout).

The use of reflection puts an additional overhead that isn’t really required. (I knew this, I should not replace it in this version but make a second version doing it a different way)
